NiceUrl
=======

This acts_as extension provides the capabilities for creating a nice url based on an attribute of the current object. You can set / unset the object id in front of the URL and choose the object attribute to use to generate the URL.

Installation
============

In your Rails app root, use the following command-line : 

	ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/Bounga/acts_as_nice_url.git


Example
=======

In your model :

	class Player < ActiveRecord::Base
	  acts_as_nice_url :id => false, :title => :full_name
	end
	
then in your views :

	link_to(:controller => :players, :action => :show, :id => @player)

or	

	player_path(@player)

Use id only in some case
------------------------

If you want to use the **id only** in the generated URL, you have to fill the id parameter with the id only, not the full object :

	link_to(:controller => :players, :action => :show, :id => @player.id)

or	

	player_path(@player.id)
